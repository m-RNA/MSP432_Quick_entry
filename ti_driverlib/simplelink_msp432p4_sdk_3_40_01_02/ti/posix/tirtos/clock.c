/*  CLOCK_REALTIME represents the realtime clock for the system. For this
 *  clock, clock_gettime() returns the time since the beginning of the
 *  Epoch. SYS/BIOS implements clock_gettime() and clock_settime() with
 *  the ti.sysbios.hal.Seconds module for CLOCK_REALTIME.
 *
 *  For SYS/BIOS, CLOCK_MONOTONIC represents the ti.sysbios.knl.Clock
 *  system clock.
 *
 *  clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) will keep track of Clock tick rollovers
 *  to ensure that it is monotonic. The tick count is 32 bits, so at a
 *  1 msec tick rate, the count rolls over every 4294967296 / 1000 seconds,
 *  or about every 50 days.
 *
 *  To detect rollover, we'll save the current tick count in clock_gettime()
 *  to prevTicks. If the current tick count is less than prevTicks, the
 *  tick count has rolled over and we'll increment rolloverCount.
 *  If clock_gettime() is not called sufficiently often (e.g. every 49 days
 *  for a 1 msec tick rate), the tick count could rollover twice without
 *  being detected. Although clock_gettime(CLOCK_MONOTONIC) would still
 *  detect one rollover, the time would be off (by 50 days for a 1 msec
 *  tick rate). To prevent this from happening, we use a Clock object
 *  with a timeout of 0xFFFFFFFF ticks, and a timeout function that
 *  checks for rollover. This prevents the application from having to
 *  call clock_gettime() sufficiently often to keep an accurate time.
 *
 *  Each time the tick count rolls over, there will be a remainder of ticks
 *  that don't make up a whole second. We need to take this into account
 *  in clock_gettime(). The following definitions are for that purpose.

 *  theoritically be equivalent to 1 second (when the tick period divides
 *  0x100000000 evenly), so it is not really a "remainder", since it ranges
 *  from 1 to TICKS_PER_SEC, instead of from 0 to TICKS_PER_SEC - 1.
 *  However, this will not affect the seconds calculation in clock_gettime(),
 *  so we can ignore this special case.
