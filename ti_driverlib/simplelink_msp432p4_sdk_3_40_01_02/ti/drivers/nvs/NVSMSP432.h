 *  @internal @brief NVS function pointer table
 *
 *  'NVSMSP432_fxnTable' is a fully populated function pointer table
 *  that can be referenced in the NVS_config[] array entries.
 *
 *  Users can minimize their application code size by providing their
 *  own custom NVS function pointer table that contains only those APIs
 *  used by the application.
 *
 *  An example of a custom NVS function table is shown below:
 *  @code
 *  //
 *  // Since the application does not use the
 *  // NVS_control(), NVS_lock(), and NVS_unlock() APIs,
 *  // these APIs are removed from the function
 *  // pointer table and replaced with NULL
 *  //
 *  const NVS_FxnTable myNVS_fxnTable = {
 *      NVSMSP432_close,
 *      NULL,     // remove NVSMSP432_control(),
 *      NVSMSP432_erase,
 *      NVSMSP432_getAttrs,
 *      NVSMSP432_init,
 *      NULL,     // remove NVSMSP432_lock(),
 *      NVSMSP432_open,
 *      NVSMSP432_read,
 *      NULL,     // remove NVSMSP432_unlock(),
 *      NVSMSP432_write
 *  };

 *  @brief      NVSMSP432 attributes
 *
 *  The 'regionBase' field must point to the base address of the region
 *  to be managed.
 *
 *  The regionSize must be an integer multiple of the flash sector size.
 *  For most MSP432 devices, the flash sector size is 4096 bytes.
 *  The NVSMSP432 driver will determine the device's actual sector size by
 *  reading internal system configuration registers.
 *
 *  Care must be taken to ensure that the linker does not unintentionally
 *  place application content (e.g., code/data) in the flash regions.
 *
 *  For CCS and IAR tools, defining and reserving flash memory regions can
 *  be done entirely within the ti_drivers_config.c file. For GCC, additional
 *  content is required in the application's linker command file to achieve
 *  the same result.
 *
 *  The example below defines a char array 'flashBuf' and uses CCS and IAR
 *  compiler pragmas to place 'flashBuf' at a specific address within the flash
 *  memory.
 *
 *  For GCC, the 'flashBuf' array is placed into a named linker section.
 *  Corresponding linker commands are added to the application's linker
 *  command file to place the section at a specific flash memory address.
 *  The section placement command is carefully chosen to only RESERVE space
 *  for the 'flashBuf' array, and not to actually initialize it during
 *  the application load process, thus preserving the content of flash.
 *
 *  The 'regionBase' fields of the two HWAttrs region instances
 *  are initialized to point to the base address of 'flashBuf' and to some
 *  offset from the base of the char array.
 *
 *  The linker command syntax is carefully chosen to only RESERVE space
 *  for the char array and not to actually initialize it during application
 *  load.
 *
 *  @code
 *  #define SECTORSIZE 0x1000
 *  #define FLASH_REGION_BASE 0x3b000
 *
 *  //
 *  // Reserve flash sectors for NVS driver use
 *  // by placing an uninitialized byte array
 *  // at the desired flash address.
 *  //
 *  #if defined(__TI_COMPILER_VERSION__)
 *
 *  //
 *  //  Place uninitialized array at FLASH_REGION_BASE
 *  //
 *  #pragma LOCATION(flashBuf, FLASH_REGION_BASE);
 *  #pragma NOINIT(flashBuf);
 *  char flashBuf[SECTORSIZE * 4];

 *
 *  #elif defined(__GNUC__)
 *
 *  //
 *  //  Place the flash buffers in the .nvs section created in the gcc linker file.
 *  //  The .nvs section enforces alignment on a sector boundary but may
 *  //  be placed anywhere in flash memory.  If desired the .nvs section can be set
 *  //  to a fixed address by changing the following in the gcc linker file:
 *
 * .nvs (FIXED_FLASH_ADDR) (NOLOAD) : AT (FIXED_FLASH_ADDR) {
 *      *(.nvs)
 * } > REGION_TEXT
 *
 *  __attribute__ ((section (".nvs")))
