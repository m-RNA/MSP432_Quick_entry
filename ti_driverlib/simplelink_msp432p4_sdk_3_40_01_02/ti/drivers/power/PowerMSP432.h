 *  @brief Structure defining a performance level.
 *
 *  The MCU performance level can be set with Power_setPerformanceLevel().
 *  A performance level is defined by this PowerMSP432_PerfLevel structure.
 *
 *  The Power driver currently supports four pre-defined performance levels:
 *  @code
 *    Level    MCLK (MHz)    HSMCLK (MHz)    SMCLK (MHz)    ACLK (Hz)
 *    -----    ----------    ------------    -----------    ---------
 *      0         12              3              3           32768
 *      1         24              6              6           32768
 *      2         48             24             12           32768
 *      3         48             48             24           32768
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Up to four optional 'custom' performance levels can be defined by the user.
 *  Performance levels are designated by an index, starting with
 *  zero.  Any custom performance levels will be indexed following the last
 *  pre-defined level.  For example, if there are 4 pre-defined levels, they
 *  will have indices from '0' to '3'. If there are custom levels defined, they
 *  will be indexed starting with '4'.
 *
 *  Eight performance level constraints are supported, one for each of the
 *  four pre-defined levels:
 *  @code
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_0
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_1
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_2
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_3
 *  @endcode
 *  plus four for the optional custom performance levels:
 *  @code
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_4
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_5
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_6
 *        PowerMSP432_DISALLOW_PERFLEVEL_7
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  The parameters that are used to define a performance level are shown below.
 *
 *  @warning There is very limited runtime error checking of the
 *  different parameters, and no checking that the ratios and parameter
 *  combinations do not result in an invalid device configuration (which could
 *  overclock or damage the device). It is therefore critical that the user
 *  ensures the values specified for a custom performance level are correct.
 *
 *  To define custom performance levels the user must add an array of
 *  PowerMSP432_PerfLevel structures to their board file, and then reference
 *  this array in the PowerMSP432_config structure. An example is shown
 *  below.
 *
 *  First, if not already included in the board file, add the includes of cs.h
 *  and pcm.h
 *
 *  @code
 *  #include <ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib/cs.h>
 *  #include <ti/devices/msp432p4xx/driverlib/pcm.h>
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Next, add an array with two new performance levels:
 *
 *  @code
 *  PowerMSP432_PerfLevel myPerfLevels[] = {
 *      { .activeState = PCM_AM_DCDC_VCORE0,
 *        .VCORE = 0,
 *        .DCORESEL = CS_DCO_FREQUENCY_12,
 *        .SELM = CS_HFXTCLK_SELECT,
 *        .DIVM = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_4,
 *        .SELS = CS_HFXTCLK_SELECT,
 *        .DIVHS = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_16,
 *        .DIVS = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_16,
 *        .SELB = CS_LFXTCLK_SELECT,
 *        .SELA = CS_LFXTCLK_SELECT,
 *        .DIVA = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_1,
 *        .flashWaitStates = 0,
 *        .enableFlashBuffer = false,
 *        .MCLK = 12000000,
 *        .HSMCLK = 3000000,
 *        .SMCLK = 3000000,
 *        .BCLK = 32768,
 *        .ACLK = 32768
 *        },
 *        { .activeState = PCM_AM_DCDC_VCORE0,
 *        .VCORE = 0,
 *        .DCORESEL = CS_DCO_FREQUENCY_24,
 *        .SELM = CS_DCOCLK_SELECT,
 *        .DIVM = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_1,
 *        .SELS = CS_DCOCLK_SELECT,
 *        .DIVHS = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_4,
 *        .DIVS = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_4,
 *        .SELB = CS_REFOCLK_SELECT,
 *        .SELA = CS_REFOCLK_SELECT,
 *        .DIVA = CS_CLOCK_DIVIDER_1,
 *        .flashWaitStates = 1,
 *        .enableFlashBuffer = true,
 *        .MCLK = 24000000,
 *        .HSMCLK = 6000000,
 *        .SMCLK = 6000000,
 *        .BCLK = 32768,
 *        .ACLK = 32768
 *      },
 *  };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  Then, update the PowerMSP432_config structure to
 *  1) reference the new custom levels, and 2) as appropriate, enable extended
 *  performance scaling support, and define the relevant extended configuration
 *  parameters.  In the first custom perf level shown above the HFXT and LFXT
 *  crystals are used as clock sources, so for this example the extended
 *  support parameters need to be specfied.
 *
 *  The code below shows additions to the PowerMSP432_config structure for this
 *  example.  The first two additions to PowerMSP432_config reference the array
 *  of custom perf levels, and indicate the number of custom levels.  The third
 *  addition enables extended support for crystals.  The remaining
 *  parameters define crystal settings, plus an application-provided ISR
 *  function for handling any Clock System fault interrupts.
 *
 *  @code
 *  const PowerMSP432_ConfigV1 PowerMSP432_config = {
 *      ...
 *      .customPerfLevels = myPerfLevels,
 *      .numCustom = sizeof(myPerfLevels) / sizeof(PowerMSP432_PerfLevel),
 *      .useExtendedPerf = true,
 *      .HFXTFREQ = CS_48MHZ,
 *      .configurePinHFXT = true,
 *      .bypassHFXT = false,
 *      .configurePinLFXT = true,
 *      .bypassLFXT = false,
 *      .LFXTDRIVE = CS_LFXT_DRIVE3,
 *      .enableInterruptsCS = true,
 *      .priorityInterruptsCS = ~0,
 *      .isrCS = &isrCS
 *  };
 *  @endcode
 */

     *  @brief Boolean specifying if pull resistors should be automatically

     *  #PowerMSP432_DEEPSLEEP_1
     *
     *  Leaving an input pin floating during a device deepsleep state will
     *  result in an increase in power consumption.  The Power Manager provides
     *  an option to automatically apply pull resistors to input pins during
     *  deepsleep, so that none are left floating. The type of pull (pull-up or
     *  pull-down) is determined by the current state sensed for each input
     *  pin, as the device is transitioning into deepsleep.  This feature is
     *  referred to as 'automatic pin parking', and is enabled with this
     *  enableParking configuration parameter.
     *
     *  If 'true', before completing a transition into deepsleep, pull resistors
     *  will be applied to all pins configured as input, with General Purpose
     *  I/O (GPIO) function (as configured in the PxSEL1 and PxSEL0 registers).
     *  On wake from deepsleep, the pull resistor settings will be restored to
     *  those in effect prior to deepsleep.
     *
     *  If 'false', pull resistors will not be automatically applied during
     *  deepsleep states.
     *
     *  @note When auto pin parking is enabled special attention must
     *  be paid to the interrupt trigger selection for GPIO pins that are
     *  expected to wake the device from deepsleep.  Specifically, the
     *  interrupt should be triggered on the leading edge of the signal
     *  transition.
     *
     *  As an example, consider a pin that is connected via a debounced
     *  button switch to ground.  An internal pull-up resistor is used
     *  versus an external pull-up resistor.  The @ref GPIO.h driver is used to
     *  manage this pin, with the following entry in the pin configuration
     *  array:
     *  @code
     *      GPIOMSP432_P1_1 | GPIO_CFG_IN_PU | GPIO_CFG_IN_INT_FALLING,
     *   @endcode
     *
     *  @note #GPIO_CFG_IN_INT_FALLING is specifically selected so that the
     *  interrupt triggers immediately upon a button press.
     *
     *  If #GPIO_CFG_IN_INT_RISING were selected, in certain situations there
     *  may be a problem with this pin being able to trigger a wakeup from
     *  deepsleep. For example, consider the case where there is an additional
     *  mechanism to wake the device from deepsleep, for example, the watchdog
     *  timer is programmed in interval timer mode, to periodically wake the
     *  device every 250ms. If the button is not pressed, when the device goes
     *  to deepsleep the pin state is sensed as high, and a pull-up resistor is
     *  automatically applied by the Power driver. At some point the button is
     *  pressed, and the pin is pulled to ground.  But since "RISING" edge was
     *  configured for the interrupt, the interrupt request has not yet been
     *  sent to the CPU. Now, while the button is still low, the interval timer
     *  wakes the device, the necessary work is done, the power policy
     *  runs in the idle loop again, and puts the device back to deepsleep.
     *  On this transition to deepsleep, the auto pin parking code runs again,
     *  but this time the button pin level is sensed as low (since the button
     *  is depressed); so this time, a pull-down resistor is applied to the pin.
     *  The device goes to deepsleep, and then eventually the button is
     *  released... but the pin is still held low by the internal pull-down
     *  resistor, so no rising edge occurs, no interrupt is signalled to the
     *  CPU, and the device stays in deesleep.
     *
     *  The above is a hypothetical example, but illustrates the importance of
     *  selecting the appropriate interrupt trigger configuration for GPIO
     *  pins when auto pin parking is enabled.  If a pin is being driven by
     *  an external circuit (versus floating with weak pull resistors as in the
     *  above example), as long as the external circuit can sufficiently drive
     *  the pin to counteract the weak pull resistor, there won't be a similar
     *  issue.
