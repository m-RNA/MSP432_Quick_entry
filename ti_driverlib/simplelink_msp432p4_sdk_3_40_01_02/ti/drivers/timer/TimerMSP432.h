 *  @file       TimerMSP432.h
 *  @brief      Timer driver interface for MSP432 devices
 *
 *  # Operation #
 *  This driver implements two independent hardware peripherals on the
 *  MSP432: Timer_A and Timer32. The Timer_A implementation supports two clock
 *  sources, SMCLK and ACLCK, with multiple clock dividers. The Timer32
 *  implementation supports a single clock source, MCLK, with 3 clock
 *  dividers. For each driver instance, the configuration of the clock dividers
 *  is determined using the clock source, period, and period units. Note that
 *  the SMCLK and MCLK frequencies can change after Timer_open().
 *
 *  ### MPS432 Timer Driver Configuration #
 *
 *  In order to use the Timer APIs, the application is required to define
 *  4 configuration items in the application ti_drivers_config.c file:
 *
 *  1.  An array of TimerMSP432_Object elements, which will be used by
 *  by the driver to maintain instance state.
 *  Below is an example TimerMSP432_Object array appropriate for the MSP432
 *  LaunchPad board:
 *  @code
 *    #include <ti/drivers/Timer.h>
 *    #include <ti/drivers/timer/TimerMSP432.h>
 *
 *    TimerMSP432_Object timerMSP432Objects[3];
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  2.  An array of TimerMSP432_HWAttrs elements that defines which
 *
 *  Below is an example TimerMSP432_HWAttrs array appropriate for the MSP432
 *  LaunchPad board:
 *  @code
 *  const TimerMSP432_HWAttrs timerMSP432HWAttrs[3] =
 *  {
 *      {
 *          .timerBaseAddress = TIMER32_0_BASE,
 *          .clockSource = TIMER_A_CLOCKSOURCE_SMCLK,
 *          .intNum = INT_T32_INT1,
 *          .intPriority = ~0,
 *      },
 *      {
 *          .timerBaseAddress = TIMER_A1_BASE,
 *          .clockSource = TIMER_A_CLOCKSOURCE_SMCLK,
 *          .intNum = INT_TA1_0,
 *          .intPriority = ~0,
 *      },
 *      {
 *          .timerBaseAddress = TIMER_A2_BASE,
 *          .clockSource = TIMER_A_CLOCKSOURCE_ACLK,
 *          .intNum = INT_TA2_0,
 *          .intPriority = ~0,
 *      },
 *  };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  3.  An array of @ref Timer_Config elements, one for each Timer instance.
 *  Each element of this array identifies the device-specific API function
 *  table, the device specific timer object instance, and the device specific
 *  Hardware Attributes to be used for each timer instance.
 *  Below is an example @ref Timer_Config array appropriate for the MSP432
 *  LaunchPad board:
 *  @code
 *    const Timer_Config Timer_config[3] = {
 *      {
 *          .fxnTablePtr = &TimerMSP432_Timer32_fxnTable,
 *          .object = &timerMSP432Objects[0],
 *          .hwAttrs = &timerMSP432HWAttrs[0]
 *      },
 *      {
 *          .fxnTablePtr = &TimerMSP432_Timer_A_fxnTable,
 *          .object = &timerMSP432Objects[1],
 *          .hwAttrs = &timerMSP432HWAttrs[1]
 *      }
 *      {
 *          .fxnTablePtr = &TimerMSP432_Timer_A_fxnTable,
 *          .object = &timerMSP432Objects[2],
 *          .hwAttrs = &timerMSP432HWAttrs[2]
 *      }
 *    };
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  4.  A global variable, Timer_count, that informs the driver how many
 *  timer instances are defined:
 *  @code
 *    const uint_least8_t Timer_count = 3;
 *  @endcode
 *
 *  # Resource Allocation #
 *  Allocation of each timer peripheral is managed through a set of resource
 *  allocation APIs. For example, the TimerMSP432_allocateTimerResource API
 *  will allocate a timer for exclusive use. Any attempt to allocate this
 *  resource in the future will result in a false value being returned from the
 *  allocation API. To free a timer resource, the TimerMSP432_freeTimerResource
 *  is used. The application is not responsible for calling these allocation
 *  APIs directly.
 *
 * ### Power Management #
 * The TI-RTOS power management framework will try to put the device into the
 * most power efficient mode whenever possible. Please see the technical
 * reference manual for further details on each power mode.
 *
 * This driver supports dynamic power performance levels. The driver will
 * determine which power performance levels are compatible with the desired
 * period and period units. The driver prevents transitions to performance
 * levels in which the period cannot be generated.
 *
 * After a performance level change, the period is recalculated such that the
 * generated period will remain the same. The exact period may vary after a
 * performance level transition. This is due to a change in clock frequency and
 * hence period per clock cycle.
 *
 *  The following statements are valid:
 *    - After Timer_open(): Clocks are enabled to the timer resource.
 *      Dynamic performance level changes are allowed.
 *    - After Timer_start(): DEEPSLEEP mode is disabled. The device can only go
 *      to Idle power mode. Performance level changes are not allowed.
 *    - After Timer_stop(): Conditions are equal as for after Timer_open.
 *    - After Timer_close(): The underlying GPTimer is turned off, and the
 *      clock to the timer and pin are disabled.
