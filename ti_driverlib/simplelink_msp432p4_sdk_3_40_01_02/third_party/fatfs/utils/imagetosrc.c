/*
 * ======== imagetosrc.c ========
 *
 * Converts a RAM disk image into a C array with symbolName.  This C file may
 * then be compiled into an application and loaded as the initial RAM disk for
 * that application.
 *
 * Usage:
 *
 *     imagetosrc [RAM-disk-filename] [output filename] [symbolname]
 *
 *     RAM-disk-filename: name of an existing RAM disk image file (usually
 *                        created with 'mkimage' utility).
 *
 *     output filename: name of the C source file to save the RAM disk image
 *                      data to on the local HDD.
 *
 *     symbol name: name to call the C array, which contains the RAM disk image
 *                  data, within the output file.
